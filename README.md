# Potty Game

## Overview

The general premise is that there is a baby that needs to get through a house (or other area) to use the bathroom. On the way to the "potty", there are several obstacles including distractions, a timer on the baby's bladder holding. By using available objects and actions, the player must guide the baby to the potty before its too late.
