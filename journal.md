## 2/15/2020 Planning Meeting

Performed first planning meeting.

Meeting attendees:

* Development Team

* Product Owner

Topics:

* Discussed definition of done and defined the Kanban column definitions.
* Discussed some high level design goals. Agreed that the puzzle aspects of the game would be determined after the initial player movement mechanics were more developed for experimentation.
* Wrote up several tickets in the back log that constitute a bare bones game architecture with title screen, credit roll, graphical representation, grid based map, and standard human interface movement controls.

Ground Rules:

* A ticket is done when it meets the description and is completely checked in and repeatable.
* At the end of each 2 week sprint, a review/demo will be performed to solicit feedback.
* During each sprint, there will be 2 standup meetings to assess the current progress between the product owner and the development team.
* At the end of each 2 week sprint, there will be a sprint planning day where the development team will work with the product owner to determine the next set of highest priority tickets to assign to the TODO column of Kanban board. A TODO list of 5 items is rule of thumb for maximum capacity.

### Sprint #1 (2/15/2020 - 2/28/2020)

* The first sprint will focus on the setting up project files, a grid based map, and a character that can move within a bounded space.
